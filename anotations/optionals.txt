An Optional in java is a container to hold a non-null value or represent the absence
of a value. It means that helps to avoid NullPointerException, by handling cases where
a value might not be there.

Instead of returning null directly, the methods can return an Optional to signal that 
a value might be absent, forcing you to handle both the presence and absence of the value.

There are many methods like isPresent(), get(), orElse(), orElseGet(), ifPresent()...
