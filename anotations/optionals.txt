An Optional in java is a container to hold a non-null value or represent the absence
of a value. It means that helps to avoid NullPointerException, by handling cases where
a value might not be there.

Instead of returning null directly, the methods can return an Optional to signal that 
a value might be absent, forcing you to handle both the presence and absence of the value.

There are many methods like isPresent(), get(), orElse(), orElseGet(), ifPresent()...

"import java.util.Optional"

isPresent() -> checks if the value is present inside the Optional object.
Optional.empty() -> returns an empty Optional instance
Optional.of(variable) -> creates an optional instance and requires a non-null argument
you need to pass the variable that needs to cointain a value diferent than null
Option.ofNullable(variable) -> ables use to pass a null value, but you might need 
to treat it after
