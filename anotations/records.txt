records is a feature that makes the implementation of a simple class in Java way easier

you don't have to write all the code if your class only has basics methods. It creates
get methods for all the variables, hashCode() method, a toString(), a equals() and even
a basic constructor.

you can overwrite other methods inside the record class, but you have to be concise that
a record class is immutable, so once it's created, its state cannot be changed. 
All components are implicity 'final'.

to use the getters, you dont need to use for e.g. getName(), you may use name() only.

how to declare a record class -> 
public record Person(String name, int age) {}

// inside the '{}' you can overwrite the code of the record.

also, you can change the constructor for example
